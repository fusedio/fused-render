"""FastAPI app: static shell, filesystem API, HTML rendering, Python execution.

No path restriction anywhere — the whole filesystem is in scope by design
(see DECISIONS.md D2/D3). All `path` query params are absolute filesystem
paths. Endpoints are sync `def` so FastAPI dispatches them to its threadpool,
giving free concurrency for blocking filesystem/subprocess work; /api/run is
async (the fused engine is async; the built-in executor is offloaded).

Execution engine (D69/D70): /api/run runs the built-in executor by **default**,
whether or not the `fused` package is installed — set `FUSED_RENDER_ENGINE=auto`
(use fused if importable, else fall back) or `=fused` (require it — fail loudly
at startup if missing) to opt in to the local compute backend (`engine.py`).
