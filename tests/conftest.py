"""Redirect app-managed state and the Fused workspace to throwaway tmp dirs for
the whole test run.

Importing fused_render.server / .executor now stages the core templates into
home_dir()/.core-templates on import (core_templates.ensure_core_templates).
This runs at collection time — before any fixture — so the redirect must be
set here at conftest import, ahead of the first test-module import, or the
copy would land in the real ~/.fused-render.

FUSED_RENDER_DIR is redirected for the same reason: /api/config reads it (D81)
and the seed tests write into it, so no test may see the real ~/Documents/Fused.

Only allocate + register cleanup when the var is unset, so a caller that set it
(CI pointing at a real dir) still wins and we don't eagerly leak a mkdtemp we
never use. The dirs we create are removed at process exit.
