# fused-render — Requirements Specification

**Status:** Draft v0.1
**Scope:** Fully local system. Never deployed to cloud. Single user, single machine.

---

## 1. Overview

fused-render is a local file explorer consisting of:

1. **A local server** that runs on the user's machine, exposes the file system, executes user-authored Python, and serves the browser UI.
2. **A browser UI** where the user browses their computer's files and views rich previews of them.

The differentiating feature is the **renderable HTML** system: HTML files can call Python functions inline for data, and can sync their internal state to the browser URL via **params**. Built-in **preview templates** for known file formats (parquet, CSV, images, …) are themselves just renderable HTML files that ship with the application — the same primitives (params + Python execution) are the entire rendering power of the system.

### Goals

- Browse the local file system in the browser with fast navigation.
- Preview any supported file format with a rich, format-appropriate UI.
- Let users author their own interactive HTML views backed by local Python code.
- Make preview URLs shareable-with-self / bookmarkable: URL fully reconstructs the view state.

### Non-Goals

- Cloud or remote deployment, multi-user access, authentication/user accounts.
- File editing (v1 is read/preview oriented; editing is a possible v2).
- Sandboxing Python for safety against the *user's own* code — the user's code is trusted. (Protecting against *other websites* driving the server is in scope; see §9.)

```

- **Server language:** Python (natural fit — it must import and execute user Python). Suggested: FastAPI + uvicorn.
- **Binding:** `127.0.0.1` on a configurable port (default e.g. 8765). Never `0.0.0.0`.
- **Startup:** single CLI command, `fused-render [--start-dir DIR] [--port N]`, opens the browser. Start dir is a UI convenience only — the whole filesystem is accessible.

---

## 3. File Explorer (Shell UI)

### Requirements

- **FS-1** Directory listing with name, size, modified time, type; sortable columns (sort state in URL params `sort`/`order`, dirs always grouped first).
- **FS-2** Breadcrumb navigation. *(tree pane, keyboard nav: follow-up)*
- **FS-3** **DECIDED:** the explorer browses the **entire computer** — there is no root-scoping concept. The CLI may take a *start directory* (`--start-dir`, default home) but it is only the initial UI location, not a restriction.
- **FS-4** v1 shows all files including dotfiles. *(hide/toggle: follow-up)*
- **FS-5** Selecting a file opens its preview (§5). Selecting a directory navigates into it.
- **FS-6** The current directory/file is reflected in the URL path so browser back/forward and refresh work: `http://localhost:8765/view/<url-encoded-path>`.
- **FS-7** *(follow-up)* Filename search/filter.
- **FS-8** "Open raw" escape hatch for any file: streams bytes with correct MIME type (used for download and by templates for images/video/pdf).

### Sidebar & Bookmarks (M2 — next)

Left sidebar in the shell, always visible:

- **SB-1** Fixed left column. Top entry **Home**: navigates to `/view/<home dir>` (the user's real `~`, independent of `--start-dir`). `GET /api/config` gains a `home` field.
- **SB-2** **Bookmarks section** below Home. A bookmark captures *whatever the right side currently shows* — directory listing or any preview — as the **exact current URL verbatim** (`/view/…?freq=2.4&_file=…`). Clicking a bookmark is a plain browser redirect (`location.href = url`); the sidebar never interprets bookmark contents, so bookmarks survive future param/dispatch changes.
- **SB-3** Capture UI: a bookmark button in the shell header area, one click, no prompt. Default name = basename of the viewed path (file or dir name).
- **SB-4** Bookmarks are renamable inline (edit affordance on hover → input → Enter/blur commits) and deletable. No confirm on delete (re-bookmarking is one click).
- **SB-5** **DECIDED: persistence = browser localStorage** (key `fused.bookmarks`, JSON array `{id, name, url, created_at}`; `id = crypto.randomUUID()`). Zero server code. Known trade-off: bookmarks are per-browser-profile; migration to a server-side file later is a trivial export.
- **SB-6** Duplicate URLs allowed; list ordered by creation time. *(drag reorder, active-bookmark highlight: polish, later)*

### Server FS API (shape, not final contract)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/fs/list?path=` | entries with metadata |
| `GET /api/fs/stat?path=` | single-entry metadata |
| `GET /api/fs/raw?path=` | streamed bytes, `Range` support (video/audio seek), correct `Content-Type` |

---

## 4. Renderable HTML

Any `.html` file on disk, when previewed, is **rendered live** (not shown as source) inside a sandboxed iframe. A "view source" toggle shows the raw text instead.

### 4.1 Runtime injection

The server serves the HTML with a small runtime `<script>` injected (or the iframe loads a bootstrap that provides it). The runtime exposes a global API (working name `fused`):

```js
// Execute main() of a Python file
const result = await fused.runPython(pathToPy, paramsObject);

// Params (see §6)
fused.params.get(name)
fused.params.set(name, value)          // strings only; always replaceState
fused.params.getAll()
fused.params.onChange(callback)   // fires whenever params change; author re-runs Python here
```

### 4.2 `runPython(path, params)`

- **RH-1** **DECIDED:** `path` may be **relative to the HTML file's own location** or **absolute** (anywhere on the machine — whole filesystem is in scope, consistent with FS-3).
- **RH-2** `params` is a flat JSON object; keys map to the Python function's keyword arguments (§5.2).
- **RH-3** Returns a Promise. Resolves with the deserialized return value; rejects with a structured error `{ type, message, traceback }` on Python exception, missing file, missing `main` function, or timeout.
- **RH-4** Concurrent calls are allowed (e.g. a page fires 3 data fetches on load). Server may queue or parallelize; ordering is not guaranteed.
- **RH-5** Calls have a configurable timeout (default e.g. 30 s), after which the worker is killed and the promise rejects.

### 4.3 Isolation — DESCOPED (v1)

- **RH-6** v1 uses a **plain same-origin iframe**; the injected runtime calls the server API directly with `fetch`. No sandbox, no postMessage bridge, no token. Previewed HTML is fully trusted.
- **RH-7** *(follow-up)* Sandboxed iframe + postMessage bridge if/when untrusted-HTML protection is wanted.
- **RH-8** Network access from inside the iframe to the outside internet: allowed.

## 5. Python Execution

### 5.1 Authoring model

**Convention over annotation:** a user Python file exposes a function named **`main`**. No decorator, no import required — a plain `.py` file works as-is:

```python
def main(city: str = "oslo", limit: int = 100):
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_parquet(f"./data/{city}.parquet").head(limit)
    return df
```

- **PY-1** When called from HTML, the executor imports the module and calls its `main` with the params. Missing or non-callable `main` → structured error.
- **PY-2** Module top-level code runs on import (normal Python semantics); side effects there are the user's responsibility.

### 5.2 Parameter binding

- **PY-3** The JS `params` object maps to keyword arguments by name.
- **PY-4** Values arrive as JSON types. If the function has type annotations, the executor coerces (`"100"` → `int 100`, `"true"` → `bool`) since URL-derived params are strings. Unannotated args receive the raw JSON value.
- **PY-5** Extra params not in the signature: ignored unless the function has `**kwargs`. Missing required args → structured error naming the missing arg.

### 5.3 Execution environment

- **PY-6** **DECIDED (v1):** execution is a **fresh subprocess per call** — always-fresh code, zero stale state, trivial timeout/kill; a crash or `sys.exit` cannot take down the server. Cost: interpreter + import time on every call. A warm worker pool is the designated v2 upgrade if interactivity demands it (API unchanged).
- **PY-7** The worker's Python interpreter/venv is configurable; default is the environment the server was launched from. (User installs pandas etc. there.)
- **PY-8** Working directory of execution = the Python file's directory, so relative data paths in user code behave intuitively.
- **PY-9** Module reload: automatic — every call is a fresh process, so edits to the .py file take effect on the next call.

### 5.4 Return value serialization

**DECIDED (v1): JSON only.** `main` must return JSON-native values (dict / list / str / num / bool / None). Anything else — including DataFrames and bytes — is a structured "return type not serializable" error; the user converts himself (e.g. `df.to_dict("records")`).

Deferred to later milestones (needed for data templates):

| Return type | Wire encoding (future) |
|---|---|
| `pandas.DataFrame` / Arrow table | Arrow IPC or `{columns, records}` JSON |
| `bytes` | binary response with declared content type |

- **PY-10** Large results: responses stream; a configurable size cap (default e.g. 100 MB) protects the browser.

### 5.5 Caching — follow-up, not in v1

- **PY-11** Optional per-call cache keyed by `(resolved py path, file mtime, params)`. Opt-in via config (per-directory or global). Keeps re-renders during param tweaking snappy.

---

## 6. Params & URL Sync

The core state-sharing mechanism between an HTML view and the browser URL.

- **PR-1** The **shell URL** is the single source of truth: `http://localhost:8765/view/path/to/sample.html?city=oslo&limit=50`.
- **PR-2** On load, the runtime hydrates `fused.params` from the shell URL's query string.
- **PR-3** **DECIDED (v1):** `fused.params.set(k, v)` updates iframe-local state and messages the shell, which updates the URL via `history.replaceState` — always. Param changes never create history entries; refresh/bookmark still reproduce state. (`pushState` opt-in is a possible later addition; API shape allows it without breakage.)
- **PR-4** Views must treat params as reactive inputs: `onChange` fires on every applied change (today: `set()` and shell-initiated updates; back/forward too if pushState ever lands).
- **PR-5** **DECIDED (v1): strings only.** Param values are strings, period — `set()` rejects non-strings, `get()` returns strings. Users JSON-encode themselves if they need structure. Zero magic.
- **PR-6** **Reserved namespace:** param keys beginning with `_` belong to the app shell (e.g. `_file`, `_raw`). User HTML cannot set them; the runtime rejects the call.
- **PR-7** Full page refresh reproduces the exact view: same file, same params, same rendered state (assuming user code is deterministic in its params).

---

## 7. Preview Templates

Built-in renderable-HTML files that ship **inside the application code**, one per supported format. They are ordinary renderable HTML — same runtime, same `runPython`, same params — proving the primitive is sufficient.

### 7.1 Dispatch

- **PT-1** **DECIDED: the registry is server-side** — single source of truth. Extension → template path mapping lives in the server; `GET /api/fs/stat` response includes `template: <abs path>|null`, and the shell simply obeys.
- **PT-2** When the user opens `data/trips.parquet`, the shell renders the returned template in the preview iframe and passes the target file as `_file=<path>` **on the iframe's own URL** (not the shell URL — its pathname already names the file, so no duplication like `/view/x.parquet?_file=/x.parquet`). Reserved `_` params are readable by the template, not settable by page code.
- **PT-3** Templates are html + py pairs living side by side in a real directory inside the package (`fused_render/templates/`), so plain **relative** `runPython` paths work unchanged — no virtual-path mechanism needed:

```js
const page = await fused.runPython("./parquet_reader.py",
                                   { file: fused.params.get("_file"),
                                     offset: "0", limit: "500" });
```

- **PT-4** Template UI state (current page, selected columns, sort) uses normal params → survives refresh, e.g. `?_file=…&offset=500&sort=fare`.

### 7.2 Template set — **M1 ships parquet, image, and text templates**; rest are follow-ups

**Shell dispatch is exactly three-way: template > html > fallback.** No file-type special-casing in the shell — image and text handling are templates like any other.

| Extension(s) | Template | M1? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.parquet` | parquet_template.html | **M1** | paged table via pyarrow, row count |
| `.png .jpg .gif .webp .svg` | image_template.html | **M1** | `<img>` via raw endpoint |
| text/code (`.txt .py .js .ts .json .md .csv .log .yaml .toml …`) | text_template.html | **M1** | fetches raw, `<pre>`; syntax highlight later |
| `.csv`, `.tsv` | csv_template.html | later | paged table, delimiter sniffing (M1: text template) |
| `.md` | markdown_template.html | later | rendered markdown (M1: text template) |
| `.mp4 .mov .mp3 .wav` | media_template.html | later | raw endpoint w/ Range |
| `.pdf` | pdf_template.html | later | browser-native embed |
| `.html` | — | M1 | rendered live (§4); "Source" toggle shows text |
| unknown | shell fallback | M1 | metadata + raw/download link (built into shell, not a template) |

- **PT-5** **User overrides (v1.5):** a user templates directory (e.g. `~/.fused-render/templates/`) checked before built-ins, so users can replace or add format handlers using the exact same mechanism.

---

## 8. Server Requirements (cross-cutting)

- **SV-1** Single process, no external services, no database. State = file system + in-memory.
- **SV-2** *(follow-up)* WebSocket/SSE push channel (progress, file-change notifications). v1: plain request/response only.
- **SV-3** *(follow-up)* Structured execution logging + dev console panel. v1: server stdout logs only; Python print() output is returned to the calling page and logged to the browser console.
- **SV-4** Graceful shutdown; per-call subprocesses die with their call.

---

## 9. Security Model — DESCOPED (v1)

**Decision: no security layer in v1.** Base layer simplicity wins; everything below is a recorded follow-up, not a requirement.

- v1 keeps only: bind `127.0.0.1` (one line, free).
- **Follow-ups (documented, not built):** session token auth; `Origin`/`Host` validation (DNS-rebinding defense); sandboxed iframe + bridge for untrusted HTML. Note for later: a localhost server that executes Python and reads the whole disk is an RCE/exfiltration primitive for any website open in the same browser — revisit before this ever runs on a shared/edge machine.


---

## 10. Tech Stack (proposed)

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Server | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, uvicorn | must run user Python; async + WS built in |
| Exec workers | `multiprocessing` pool or subprocess-per-call | isolation, kill-on-timeout |
| Shell UI | Vite + React + TypeScript | fast to build tree/table UI; any SPA framework acceptable |
| Data tables in templates | Arrow JS + a virtualized grid | large parquet/csv without choking |
| Packaging | `pipx install fused-render` → `fused-render` CLI | single-command local install |

---

## 11. Open Questions

1. ~~Whole-disk vs scoped root~~ — **RESOLVED: whole computer, no root concept (FS-3).**
2. ~~Python env~~ — **RESOLVED: the env the server was launched from. Good enough.**
3. ~~Streaming/partial results~~ — **RESOLVED: not required.**
4. **Editing** — is write support (rename/delete/save) wanted in v1 or strictly v2?
5. **Multiple entry functions per file** addressed by name (`runPython("f.py#chart")`) — needed, or keep `main`-only?
6. ~~Param change → auto re-run?~~ — **RESOLVED: manual — author wires `runPython` inside `params.onChange`. Declarative binding possible later, layered on top.**

---

## 12. macOS Distribution (DMG) — M3

Distribute as a DMG containing a menu-bar app; all UI stays in the browser.

- **DM-1** **DECIDED:** `.app` bundles a **standalone CPython** (python-build-standalone) with `fused_render` + deps preinstalled. Server and executor run on it unchanged (`Resources/python/bin/python3 -m fused_render.app`). No PyInstaller freezing — it would break the subprocess executor (`sys.executable`) and seal the env.
- **DM-2** **DECIDED:** user `runPython` code executes on the **bundled interpreter only** — no override mechanism in v1. The bundled python ships the popular data stack preinstalled (`[bundled]` extra in pyproject.toml: numpy, pandas, requests, duckdb, polars, matplotlib, scipy, pillow, openpyxl, shapely, geopandas — plus core pyarrow) since users cannot add libs through the product. (Escape hatch that costs us nothing: the bundled python is a real python — advanced users can pip into it manually.) This supersedes D14's "env the server was launched from" for the packaged app; dev installs (`pip install -e .`) keep D14 behavior.
- **DM-3** **DECIDED:** lifecycle via **menu bar icon** (NSStatusItem through `rumps`): Open in browser / Copy URL / Quit. `LSUIElement=true` — no Dock icon, no windows. "No proper UI" preserved.
- **DM-4** **DECIDED:** unsigned (ad-hoc) for now — testers right-click→Open once. Build script keeps a signing/notarization hook for a future Developer ID.
- **DM-5** Launch flow: double-click → pidfile check (`~/Library/Application Support/fused-render/`) → already running ⇒ just open browser; else start server (port 8765, fall forward if taken), write pidfile, open browser.
- **DM-6** DMG = drag-to-Applications window; built by `scripts/build_dmg.sh` (pinned python-build-standalone → pip install → assemble .app → ad-hoc sign → `hdiutil`). Build installs `.[bundled]`; expect a few hundred MB compressed (scipy/matplotlib/geopandas dominate).
- **DM-7** New module `fused_render/app.py`: menu-bar entry point wrapping the existing server (uvicorn in a thread). CLI (`fused-render`) remains for dev use.

## 12b. Milestones

- **M1 — Base layer (current focus):** server + shell, whole-disk browsing, raw streaming, live-rendered HTML in plain iframe, `runPython` → `main()` subprocess execution, params ↔ URL sync (strings, replaceState), server-side template registry (dispatch: template > html > fallback) + **parquet, image, text templates**. No security, no WS, no caching.
- **M2 — Sidebar & bookmarks:** SHIPPED.
- **M3 — DMG distribution:** menu-bar app + bundled CPython + build script (§12).
- **Follow-ups (unordered):** remaining preview templates (csv/json/markdown/media/pdf/syntax-highlighted code); user template overrides (`~/.fused-render/templates/` checked first); warm worker pool; DataFrame/Arrow returns; security layer (token, origin checks, sandboxed bridge); exec console; search/sort/tree/keyboard nav; caching; user template overrides; editing.
