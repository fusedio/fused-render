"""What the Diffusers image runner FETCHES, and what it deliberately does not.

The recipe in `diffusers_image/worker.py` swaps a 2.6GB GGUF transformer in for
the repo's own 7.8GB bf16 one, and the whole value of that swap is bytes not
downloaded. It was silently worth nothing: the skip list named
`transformer/*.safetensors`, and `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` ALSO
carries a root-level `flux-2-klein-4b.safetensors` — the same weights again, as
one ComfyUI-style bundle — which no skip pattern matched, `from_pretrained`
never opens, and `download_snapshot` fetched. 18.6GB arrived where the model
needs 10.8.

So the patterns are an ALLOW-list now, and this file is what keeps them honest:
the assertions are made against a FROZEN listing of the real repo, run through
`worker_base.selects` — the same filter the bar's total, the segmented fetch and
`snapshot_download` all use — rather than against a re-reading of the pattern
strings. A deny-list has to predict every extra bundle a repo might carry; this
test asks the only question that matters, which is what lands on the disk.
